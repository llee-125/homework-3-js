## Password Generator
This is an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria (numbers, lc letters, up letters and numbers). This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## User Story
Password Generator will allow me to practice functions for loops and a full app. I need more practice.

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password
WHEN I click the button to generate a password
THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria
WHEN prompted for password criteria
THEN I select which criteria to include in the password
WHEN prompted for the length of the password
THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters
WHEN prompted for character types to include in the password
THEN I choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters
WHEN I answer each prompt
THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected
WHEN all prompts are answered
THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria
WHEN the password is generated
THEN the password is either displayed is written to the page
AND all input is available on console.log for validation

## Features
* Used Alerts to ask the questions of what digits are requested within the password.
* Console.log all input
* Minimal decor on page
* Tried to add a clear password button, need more direction--to come.

## Improvements Needed
* Add 2 buttons "hide" and "show" to toggl the password on the screen, while keeping password visable on console.log.
